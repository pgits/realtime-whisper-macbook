# Hugging Face cache (models downloaded here)
# If you don't want to upload downloaded models, add this.
# However, for small models like tiny.en, it might be fine,
# but for larger models, definitely ignore.
# If you omit this, the downloaded model data might be committed!
# Usually in ~/.cache/huggingface or project_dir/.cache/huggingface
# You might need to find the exact path if it's within your project.
